🏦 Project Title: The Bank Queue (Poisson) Simulator

📘 Description

This project simulates how customers arrive and are served in a bank during an 8-hour day.
It uses probability and random events to model real-life customer arrivals and teller service times.
The goal is to help the bank analyze average wait times, queue lengths, and teller performance to decide if another teller is needed.
